NORB-Rocket-Predictor
=====================

Advanced prediction software to model the trajectory of a rocket based on many variable factors. 
This is an on-going project.



At the moment, many variables are pre-defined as we haven't reached the stage of making them user-definable.



Upon completion, this software will perform as described here: http://www.norb.co.uk/projects/rocket-trajectory-predictor/
